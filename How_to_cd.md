How to make a schematic design

To prevent the player slider from obstructing the bottom panel with buttons, it is recommended to expand it to full screen when watching a video. Flashing orange buttons on the bottom panel means that the corresponding button has been pressed on the keyboard. But you can also click on it with the mouse if you prefer. Let's go!

1) First specify the project folder and then enter the project name in the main line. The program will create a folder of the same name in which it will place your project. In the course of work, many different files associated with the project will appear in this folder. The Schematic Constructor can import parts from other projects by pressing the F1 button, and for this, all projects must be stored in a shared folder. The new version of Schematic Constructor (1.1) has a parameter called "index to project folder". It indicates the storage depth of the project relative to the main folder. By default, it is 1, but if your project is stored inside a folder of another project, then set the value to 2.

2) The Schematic Constructor comes with a template file, Template.cds, which has a frame with captions. Insert this file into your project to get started. You can edit the Template.cds file like a normal project, change this frame, and save. In Schematic Constructor you can attach any image in BMP or JPEG format to any polyline. The image takes the size of the rectangle that describes the polyline, so you can set the image to any size. It should be noted that there is a fundamental difference between importing a BMP and a JPEG file. A JPEG file is uploaded with preservation of the entire color gamut and is supported by the built-in PDF printer, while BMP is uploaded as a background image, where the color of the first pixel in the file is replaced by the color of the working background of the program screen (for copying or other purposes), it is not printed ...

3) This video shows you how to change the polyline layer and thickness. After you have completely drawn your design, you can select all objects with a frame and give them the same thickness if you want.

15) Press the F9 key to generate all networks on the current page. By default, the program will create network names in the NETxxxxx format.
When a polyline segment is selected, press the N hotkey to highlight the entire net. A complete list of hotkeys can be found in the HELP menu
