### How to work with selection mask?

Items in the layout are selected for editing by clicking on them or drawing a rectangle around them with the mouse. Since items may overlap one another, sometimes it may be difficult to select exactly the item(s) that you want. In this case, the selection mask can be used to enable or disable the selection of different item types. It consists of a list of these types, with a colored box next to each one. A green box means that the item type can be selected, while a red box means that it can't. You can toggle the state of each box by clicking on it. You can invert the mask by clicking on it with the control button held down.
