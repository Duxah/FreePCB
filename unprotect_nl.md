 When netlist is protected, it is impossible:
 
* delete a part if at least one pin is connected
* change the part number
* connect pin to netlist
* remove pin from netlist

It should be borne in mind:

* Parts with just one pin can be added to the netlist by dragging and dropping the connection, as well as removed from the circuit board, if desired.
* Footprint can be changed if the number of pins does not become less.
