There are three grids in `FREEPCB`:

- visible grid (which can be disabled on the layer panel in the left part of the window)
- grid for parts.
- grid for tracing.

_All default settings are stored in the file DEFAULT.CFG which is located in the root directory of FREEPCB. You can open this file in a text editor and carefully modify it, observing the format._
