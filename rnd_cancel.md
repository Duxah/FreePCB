# remove arc elements..

You can remove fillet elements (for copper traces or copper areas), if any, in your PCB design. Select the Project -> Arc Elements menu item and the program will select the rounding elements of copper tracks and copper areas. Then press the DeleteBridge (F9) button to delete these items. If you want to delete only the elements of copper traces, and keep the elements of copper areas, then check the box in the selection mask opposite the copper areas (menu on the left), and then these elements will not be selected.
