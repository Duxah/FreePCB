### Nets

![](pictures/nets.png)

To start editing trace widths and vias for nets, go to Project->Nets in the main menu. A dialog box will open. As can be seen from the screenshot, we will consider four options for setting parameters for nets. In the first two lines we see that both the width of the traces and the size of vias are set by default. In this case, FreePcb-2 takes the value of the width of the trace and the size of the vias from the Project->Options dialog box for the default values (see. Fig.)
