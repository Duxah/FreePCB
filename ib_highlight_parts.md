### How to highlight parts from InfoBox

Click on a part in the list and press ENTER, then click on the next and press ENTER again, etc.
When a new part is highlighted, the previous one remains highlighted. As a result, several details are highlighted. Now you can enter the Project -> Parts main menu and edit the attributes of these parts, or edit the size and thickness of the silk-screen lines by pressing the F9_EDIT_CILK key
