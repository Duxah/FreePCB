When the project printed circuit board at your enterprise is serial, it makes sense to store in a special library the nomenclature of parts identified by the combination of VALUE & PACKAGE parameters. You can at any time through Infobox find out in which project this or that part was used. Open the circuit board project whose list of parts you want to export. Remove from the list parts that do not have the Value and Package attributes, for this, type the line !--- in the filter box as shown in the figure.
