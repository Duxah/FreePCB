### How to select part?

Mouse over a part and left click. If you hit the pin, the pin will be highlighted, since the pin area is less than the area of the part. Need to click again. If there are too many objects, you can use the selection mask on the left side of the screen. Click on the "Parts" line with the control key pressed to invert the mask and allow the selection of parts only.

If the part is connected to other parts through the "merge" property, the merge will be highlighted. You need to click again or prohibit the "merge" in the selection mask.
