Open the "Insert Nets" application from the menu of the right button of the Infobox, and in it we indicate the text size of the  net names, as well as the coordinate of the upper left corner of the array of text strings. This is actually the place where we want to insert this text. When you click on the text, the net will be half-highlighted. To highlight at full brightness, press N.
