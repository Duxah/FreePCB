# About development
---
The FreePcb-2.000 and above program presented on this site is an upgrade of version 1.359 published in 2010. Now FreePcb has made great strides in comparison with the 2010 version and is suitable for both simple and large-scale developments, although the appearance remains the same. Includes footprint editor, provides the ability to create your own libraries, can import external netlists in the PADS-PCB format, supports the preservation of REF-names of parts when paneling printed circuit boards. The program is focused on accessibility, ease of use, saving computer hard disk memory, but at the same time it includes almost all the tools necessary for professional use. A distinctive feature of this program is the interface with the use of function keys, which speeds up the process of editing a printed circuit board for an experienced user. Start working with FreePCB right now to appreciate all benefits of this interface.
