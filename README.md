Includes footprint editor, provides the ability to create your own libraries, can import external netlists in the PADS-PCB format, supports the preservation of REF-names of parts when paneling printed circuit boards. The program is focused on accessibility, ease of use, saving computer hard disk memory, but at the same time it includes almost all the tools necessary for professional use. A distinctive feature of this program is the interface with the use of function keys, which speeds up the process of editing a printed circuit board for an experienced user.
