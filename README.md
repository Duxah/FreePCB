# `About`
The FreePcb-2.000 or later program presented on this site is a development branch of version [1.359](http://freepcb.com), published in 2010. FreePcb-2 contains new features not available in version 1.359 and provides more freedom for circuit board developers. Start working with FreePcb-2 right now to feel the difference. If you don’t want to waste your time mastering complex CAD applications, download FreePcb-2, which can do almost everything the same, but is easy to learn and takes up little disk space on your computer. FreePcb-2 does not have a huge number of buttons (as in other CAD systems), the purpose of which is not immediately clear. There are only 9 buttons (F1, F2 ... F9), the Functions of which change depending on the type of the selected element, so FreePcb-2 can be studied even without instructions. There is also a right-click context menu with additional features. In FreePcb, you can create a netlist manually by adding parts and then connecting their pins. But you can also import a netlist in the PADS-PCB format from any external circuit editor, for example TinyCad.

# `The program is focused on:`
1. accessibility (it does not have a limit on the number of pins, footprint libraries or any other parameters, it has only limitations on 10,000 parts contained in the project file, but this is more than enough for most developments),
2. ease of learning (creating a manual for version 2-031),
3. reduction of time for the development of printed circuit boards (A distinctive feature of FreePcb and FreePcb-2 from other PCB-editors is an interface using function keys, which speeds up the process of editing a printed circuit board for an experienced user),
4. saving computer memory (takes ~ 50MB hard drive),
but at the same time includes almost all the tools needed for professional use (suitable for small businesses).

# `Latest improvements and new features`

`Version 2-031 (2019-10-15):`

* Now, when you hover over a pin, the pin name and network name appear next to it. This is especially useful when manually editing netlist (creating pin pinlines)

# `Get started with FreePcb-2`
Download the folder with the application and run the file FreePcb.exe

### `Training on the example of the smart_kitchen.fpc file in the EXAMPLES folder`
In this example, 3 independent circuit boards. (printed circuit board panel). In the context menu of the right mouse button, click the full view to see them entirely. From the Tools main menu, launch the Infobox application, which will help you find the pcb part in the project.
