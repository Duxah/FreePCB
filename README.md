* Uses English or metric units (i.e. mils or mm) for most functions.
* Footprint Wizard and Footprint Editor for creating or modifying footprints
* Import and automatic export of PADS-PCB lists
* Import and export to mechanical format DXF
* Import and export Pcad ASCII files
* Exports extended Gerber files (RS274X) and Excellon drill files

# About
The FreePcb-2.000 or later program presented on this site is a development branch of version [1.359](http://freepcb.com), published in 2010. FreePcb-2 contains new features not available in version 1.359 and provides more freedom for circuit board developers. Start working with FreePcb-2 right now to feel the difference.

***
# The program is focused on:
1. accessibility (it does not have a limit on the number of pins, footprint libraries or any other parameters, it has only limitations on 10,000 parts contained in the project file, but I think that this is more than enough),
2. ease of learning (creating a manual for version 2-028),
3. reduction of time for the development of printed circuit boards (A distinctive feature of FreePcb and FreePcb-2 from other PCB-editors is an interface using function keys, which speeds up the process of editing a printed circuit board for an experienced user),
4. saving computer memory (takes ~ 35MB hard drive),
but at the same time includes almost all the tools needed for professional use (suitable for small businesses).

`Version 2-028 (2019-06-12):`

* In the footprint editor, you can edit a group of objects: duplication, rotation, mirroring.
* Added warning in DRC check if PCB name is missing
* When you press the buttons 3 or 4 again, the silk screen layer goes to the background
* Now you can move the side of the polyline with the keyboard arrows
* A button to quickly [export gerber files to ViewMate](https://youtu.be/ZzjedfBTwvc) has been added to the File menu. (for viewing and printing)
* Overwrite protection when saving a file that was created in FreePcb version 1.359
* Specifying a folder with FreePcb-2 projects in the INFOBOX SETTINGS menu is no longer required (21.06.2019)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duxah/FreePCB/master/pictures/cloud-down.png) The [download](https://github.com/Duxah/FreePCB-2/archive/master.zip) (Updated 27.06.2019!) includes a folder with the program, manual 1.359, footprint libraries, examples of printed circuit boards, a description of the 2.028 file format for developers.

## Get started with FreePcb-2
Download the folder with the application and run the file FreePcb.exe

### Training on the example of the smart_kitchen.fpc file in the EXAMPLES folder
In this example, 3 independent circuit boards. (printed circuit board panel). In the context menu of the right mouse button, click the full view to see them entirely. From the Tools main menu, launch the Infobox application, which will help you find the pcb part in the project.
