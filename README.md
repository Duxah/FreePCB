# About development
------------------------------------
The FreePcb-2.000 and above program presented on this site is an upgrade of version [1.359](www.freepcb.com) published in 2010. Now FreePcb has made great strides in comparison with the 2010 version and is suitable for both simple and large-scale developments, although the appearance remains the same. Includes footprint editor, provides the ability to create your own libraries, can import external netlists in the PADS-PCB format, supports the preservation of REF-names of parts when paneling printed circuit boards. The program is focused on accessibility, ease of use, saving computer hard disk memory, but at the same time it includes almost all the tools necessary for professional use. A distinctive feature of this program is the interface with the use of function keys, which speeds up the process of editing a printed circuit board for an experienced user. Start working with FreePCB right now to appreciate all benefits of this interface.

# Major improvements and new features
----------------------------------------
* Improved graphical display of selected objects
* Improved detailing frame
* free rotation of parts
* [moving the group to the opposite side](https://youtu.be/WTI2HnneCzk)
* set of zero coordinate on any object(menu TOOLS)
* [merge a group of parts into one object](https://youtu.be/ef0Bef-Ql0M)
* [alignment of parts](https://youtu.be/5YJZ7ADQruM)
* [alignment of traces](https://youtu.be/Sb_mCNirUw4)
* [alignment of mergers](https://youtu.be/dCAhdzjO4l8)
* Improved work with polygons
* the ability to set a specified gap between any lines [(set_clearance)](https://youtu.be/Z1GgYGOtFfU)
* preparation of the code for the introduction of micro transition holes
* possibility of rounding corners of traces
* possibility of adding smooth transition holes
* changing some parameters at once
* combining several footprints into one directly in PCB editing mode
* the ability to organize libraries alphabetically, by the number of pins or by the number of holes
* external program [infobox.exe](https://youtu.be/I0mb6RNXuqo) knows how to [find parts](https://youtu.be/8IQnL1ws65g) on a printed circuit board
* in freepcb, you can not fill copper polygons. gaps are drawn automatically when creating the Gerber files, but sometimes you need to fill it. External program [AREA_SPLITTER.EXE](https://youtu.be/2jqGSPgFSpU) fills polygons
* [export to mechanical format dxf](https://youtu.be/5NpD_ZXCbkI)
* import from dxf
* [import pictures from bmp](https://youtu.be/WMQjF043Kko)
* [Export to commercial PCAD (ACCEL ASCII)](https://youtu.be/G5TM_Og5mOk)
* Import PCAD( ACCEL ASCII )
