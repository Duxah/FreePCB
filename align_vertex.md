# How to align vertices of trace?

### You can align vertex of the trace segment along X or Y coordinates. 

Click on another vertex or pad you want to align the unaligned vertex with. The coordinates of the other vertex or pad will be memorized and will serve as a basis for aligning the vertex. Then click on the vertex you want to align. Press F7 or F8 depending on the alignment axis (X or Y) you want to use. 

### You can align vertex of the trace segment given the coordinates of the previous and next vertices.

Select unaligned vertex. Click F3 to align the connected trace segments at 180°, 135°, 90°, 45° or 0° angles between segments.
