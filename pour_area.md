3) Clearance for all holes
3) Clearance for pins, traces, texts on different net
4) Clearance for board outline (You can create an area to fill more board_outline and select this option. You will end up with a fill inside board_outline.)
5) Clearance for copper areas on different net
6) Clearance for solder mask of pads on different net (You can use when you need to free up space around the pad, for example when using a label for a PCB machine:

7) Ground clearance for thermal pad. (Usually, a thermo-pad needs less clearance than on different nets).
8) You can re-fill the rectangle area. (In this case, you need to delete the outdated area after the fill.
