It may be necessary to insert a two-pin part in the route branch, so that, for example, then divide the network into 2 different ones.

I will show you with a simple example how to do this. 

We put the part in the place where there will be a gap, then add two additional nodes to the segment of the route. 

Connect these nodes to the pins. Now delete the extra segment by pressing the F9 button.

Now you can divide the network into 2 different.
