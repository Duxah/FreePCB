### `Comparing partlists`

To compare the list of parts (according to the RefDes Value Footprint attributes) between the current and previous version of the printed circuit board, you need to load the netlist of the previous version of the printed circuit board into Infobox. It is useful to know that in FreePcb-2 the netlist is automatically saved to the cookie folder when you simply click the save project button. This netlist is saved in the usual PADS-PCB format and is therefore suitable for loading into Infobox as an external netlist. Go to the cookie folder of the previous project and select the file with the * .net extension. Downloading the file is described in the previous paragraph. When the netlist is already loaded into Infobox, then this analysis will not be difficult to do. First of all, look at what exactly is in the drop-down list of the search box (in the CNetlist column). If the files are identical in all instances, then the list will only contain the string All matches.
