In FREEPCB-2, you can combine several parts into a merge. Connections as well as copper areas will be automatically selected and added if they are inside this group. Any other objects except connections can be added to the MERGE group:
Â 
- polyline
- text
- a copper area not connected to this group,
- cutout in a mask.

To create a MERGE object, select the parts and those objects that you want to include in this group and press F2_Create_Merge.

In the dialog box, you need to enter a name and set the clearance for polygons with hatching EDGE or NONE. What does it mean? For polygons with EDGE or NONE hatching, clearance on different nets is generated when creating gerber files, and therefore is not currently displayed on the screen. This clearance is set in the gerber export settings dialog box (call Ctrl + G), but it will be individual for each MERGE object.

In the following example, a merge is created where inverse polygons with NONE hatching and a side width of 0.2 mm are used, and therefore an individual clearance is also set to 0.2 mm.
