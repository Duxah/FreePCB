### SPLIT NET

Here both pin paths of this part have one common net.

Sometimes you need to divide the net into two different ones, while preserving all the routes and polygons. What conditions must be met for successful separation?

 * the network is split only on rat lines
 * the rat-line should not be artificially created (manually), but should be created by the rat-line recalculation program (in the mode when nothing is selected, press the F9 (Recalculate Ratlines) button), if the rat-line does not disappear or vice versa appears, then this it is the same rat line along which you can cut the net.
Highlight this segment and press F7 (Split Net).

A new net "N2" has formed, which can be renamed. When the pin is highlighted, press F5 (Edit Net)
