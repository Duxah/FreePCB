With buttons `1` and `2` you can switch the view of the board `TOP view` and `BOTTOM view`, respectively. In this case, the visibility of the opposite layer is automatically turned off.

With buttons `3` and `4` you can change the priority display layer of the `TOP COPPER` layer and `BOTTOM COPPER` layer, respectively. If you press the button again, the corresponding layer of silk-screen printing will go to the background. Sometimes useful.
